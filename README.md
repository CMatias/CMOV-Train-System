# CMOV-Train-System

### Repository for the first assignment of the [Mobile Computing](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=384972) course from the Master's in Informatics of [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial)

This project consisted in creating two mobile apps for the Android platform and a server in a platform of the students choosing to simulate the purchase and validation of the tickets.

The first app developed targets the Customers and allows for the visualization of the train routes, purchasing the tickets and displaying a QR Code of the ticket. 
The second app targets the Ticket Inspectors and allows for the validation of tickets.

The server was developed in Node.js and is responsible for feeding all the information necessary to keep the apps running such as:

* Authenticate users
* Get available trips
* Purchase tickets
* Choose a seat on the train
